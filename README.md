# Text Mining Project

# Project background

The project is the outcome of an internship with an energy company that wanted to utilise their data from customer service logs in order to obtain insight into them, starting off with analysing occurences, so they were looking for someone to create a proof of concept for that idea.

# Tech stack used
The data was stored in ElasticSearch.
The front-end was implemented using Streamlit, which is a framework on top of Python.
